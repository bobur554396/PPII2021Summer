Almaty (/ˈælməti/; Kazakh pronunciation: [ɑlmɑˈtə]; Cyrillic: Алматы), 
formerly known as alma-Ata and Verny (Russian: Верный), is the largest city 
in Kazakhstan, with a population of about 2,000,000 people, about 11% of the 
country's total population,[5] and more than 2.7 million in its built-up area that
 encompasses Talgar, Boraldai, Otegen Batyr and many other suburbs. It served as capital 
 of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic and later independent Kazakhstan from 1929 to 1997.
 [6] In 1997, the government relocated the capital to Akmola (renamed Astana in 1998, later 
renamed Nur-Sultan in 2019) in the north of the country.
